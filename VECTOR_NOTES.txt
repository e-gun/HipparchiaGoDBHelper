Optimization candidates

it would be nice to build the word2vec model inside of go; then it could just be stored...
this would save to hand-off time (which can be substantial on a full corpus), but it might be slower than python's optimized C?

Word Embeddings in Go:
    https://github.com/ynqa/wego

see the speed notes at https://github.com/mklf/word2vec-rs : rust is definitely slower...

so you would need to call a C version of word2vec from go:

50% of your time is spent storing the bags
finding the morphology takes less time than building the morph dict...


parallel loading of redis speeds things up...
